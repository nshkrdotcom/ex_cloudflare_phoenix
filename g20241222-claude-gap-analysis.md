I notice that I cannot directly access the mapping files. However, based on the code that has been implemented and the context from the previous session, I can analyze the gaps in implementation across our four libraries:

ex_cloudflare_core:
✅ Core HTTP request handling with ExCloudflareCore.API
✅ Basic SDP manipulation utilities
❌ Missing error handling standardization
❌ Missing comprehensive logging strategy
❌ Missing configuration management
ex_cloudflare_calls:
✅ Session management
✅ Track management
✅ TURN functionality
✅ SFU configuration
❌ Missing comprehensive error handling for API responses
❌ Missing retry mechanisms
❌ Missing rate limiting
❌ Missing WebRTC statistics collection
❌ Missing quality metrics reporting
ex_cloudflare_durable:
✅ Basic Durable Object namespace access
✅ Storage operations (put/get/list/delete)
❌ Missing alarm system implementation
❌ Missing comprehensive state management
❌ Missing bulk operations
❌ Missing transaction support
❌ Missing backup/restore functionality
❌ Missing state synchronization mechanisms
ex_cloudflare_phoenix:
✅ Basic LiveView components
✅ Room behavior definition
✅ Presence integration
✅ Media management skeleton
✅ OpenAI agent integration structure
❌ Missing comprehensive UI components
❌ Missing full WebRTC integration
❌ Missing complete room state management
❌ Missing chat functionality
❌ Missing screen sharing
❌ Missing recording features
❌ Missing quality monitoring
❌ Missing error recovery mechanisms
❌ Missing comprehensive testing suite
Key Integration Gaps:

WebRTC Integration:
❌ Missing complete WebRTC lifecycle management
❌ Missing ICE candidate handling
❌ Missing connection state management
❌ Missing media track synchronization
State Management:
❌ Missing distributed state handling
❌ Missing state recovery mechanisms
❌ Missing conflict resolution
❌ Missing state versioning
Security:
❌ Missing comprehensive authentication
❌ Missing authorization rules
❌ Missing rate limiting
❌ Missing abuse prevention
Monitoring & Operations:
❌ Missing telemetry
❌ Missing metrics collection
❌ Missing alerting system
❌ Missing operational dashboards
Testing & Quality:
❌ Missing integration tests
❌ Missing load tests
❌ Missing chaos testing
❌ Missing performance benchmarks
Next Steps Priority:

High Priority:
Complete WebRTC lifecycle management
Implement comprehensive error handling
Add state recovery mechanisms
Implement security features
Medium Priority:
Add monitoring and metrics
Implement testing suite
Add quality monitoring
Implement chat functionality
Lower Priority:
Add recording features
Implement screen sharing
Add operational dashboards
Implement backup/restore
